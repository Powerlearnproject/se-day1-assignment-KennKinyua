Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software.
Benefits
Reliability- it ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications like healthcare ,finance. 
Efficiency - it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Mastering complexity
Mastering process
Mastering machine


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning - identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.
Requirement analysis - identify the final user specification. 
Design - building the framework. 
Coding - converting software design into tangible code.
Testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology - Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on. : Low flexibility, and changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
Agile methodology - Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints) : High flexibility, and regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer
Developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
Maintaining and updating software to keep it functional. 
Collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software.

Quality Assurance Engineer - collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
Create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow
Confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment. 

Project Manager - assembles and lead the software development team.
Discuss the project and it's requirement with the client and software developers.
Create blueprint for the project.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts.
Importance.
IDE contains many intelligent features for automatically writing or editing the source code.
An IDE can format the written text by automatically making some words bold or italic, or by using different font colors. 


Version Control Systems (VCS) - are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. eg Git
importance:
Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts.
Change Tracking: Records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification. 


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Limited Infrastructure
Time constraints
Software Accessibility and Usability 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit tests - They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software.
Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
Importance:
Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language modelsâ€™ training data.
Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Draw a picture of a person
Draw a full-body portrait of a young woman with long brown hair, wearing a red jacket and blue jeans, standing in a park on a sunny day with trees and grass in the background.
Clarity: The improved prompt specifies what is being asked (a full-body portrait) rather than just a "person.
Specific Details: Describing the woman's appearance (long brown hair, red jacket, blue jeans) and the setting (park, sunny day, trees, grass) gives clear guidance on the image to be created.
Concise: The additional details provide a clear picture without being overly complicated, making it easier for the artist to understand exactly what is needed.
